  Odell discussed how the internet has changed greatly from when she was young. Before, the internet took on a variety of understandable, “realistic” formats in order to get people to start using it and to start understanding it. The “How-to” videos were an integral part of this process, and now, it has transformed to be more informal with people and children filming their own videos on how to do things. However, this has also taken a turn due to sponsorships and hgh self-production videos, which coats such videos in a layer of artifice and makes Odell nostalgic for the before-times when how-to videos were more clearly defined as corporate or not, as well as a time when people could just share themselves both in authentically and mundane ways. They specifically name “A Hole in Space” when people were simply fascinated with being able to see, in real-time, other people in L.A. or N.Y.C. go about their day-to-day lives. Odell also discusses searching out such mundane videos and pictures through specific apps and websites, and is still wondering how we can breach different internet communities now that algorithms and polarization have divided us even online, and how some people will still be violent regardless of such dialogue. 
<br>
As for Schwulst’s piece, she discusses what forms and meanings a website can be because people like
her students asked her about it. She also explains the technical side of a website, such as it being
files in a server. She uses metaphors to explain what a website can be, specifically a room, a shelf,
a plant, a garden, a puddle, a falling rock into an ocean, which can be seen as an alternative to
the internet as a cloud or as tubes. By thinking about the internet in this way, we do not have to
let corporations overrun what it is and what a website can mean, and we can also create a more
responsible internet.
<br>
<br>1. When we talk about the internet and polarization that occurs on it, why do we focus on reaching across the aisle to those who operate on harm instead of giving more power to those who are marginalized? What can the internet look like if we switched our thinking in this way?
<br>2. In what ways does "old-time" internet (talking to strangers and making friends, seeing people's mundane lives) still persevere today? Is the author completely correct in their analysis or has it simply taken on different forms that they no longer are in touch with? 
<br>3. Why is there always an attempt to connect technology/the internet to nature, and what are the implications of us/dominant society already having divorcing the internet/technology from nature?

Baladi discusses the role of media in the uprisings and social unrest that occurred in Egypt throughout the 2010s. She talks about how the internet enabled more people to know more about the events going on in the country, and her specific art/media project Vox Populi. Through it, she was able to screen videos of Egyption social movements that were previously not seen by many of the local audience because they did not have access to the internet. Artists like her continued making controversial work that broke through and criticized the barriers of the country, and regular people were able to join in on this too with graffiti, or their phone's pictures, videos, and other documentation. However in 2013-14 the government began cracking down on these proletariat forms of expression. This did not stop such groups because the internet could still give them exposure to those inside and outside the country, like through Buzzfeed. At the same time, there is the worry that this digital media will disappear, as her Tahrir Archives info graph shows dead sites. Baladi ultimately concludes that it is important to continue resisting by preserving this information.
<br> 
Soulellis talks about how art and design have been intertwined with protests and social movements. He goes into his specific experience as a white gay man, who watched the development of gay protest in the pre-2000s. His own fears about his queerness connect to this art and organizing actions, and how these slow developments of discovering one's identity is this "urgentcraft." He talks about his own work and archiving that tries to "slow down" and fight against the speedy content of the internet. This is especially important when he realized through Internet Archive that the Trump administration removed web pages about marginalized groups. He printed out the original Obama pages in an attempt to not forget these actions, and also connects it to other resistant actions people have pursued like printing out politician's tweets, standing in front of a racist art piece then being documented doing that and spread online, etc. Urgentcraft also seeks to rebel against expectations of technology today, like perfection, visibility, and legibility, which also connects to queer identity and struggle. He talks about  his own Queer.Archive.Work and other independent art projects and publications that embody urgentcraft, and they also intersect with topics of community spaces, racism, capitalism, and more. He was also able to digitize material that had never been online previously, and was able to preserve queer or other marginalized peoples' history in this way. He encourages viewers to do urgentcraft as well, and to connect this work to personal struggle and growth.
<br> 
Questions:
<br> 1. What other social movements today have been growing alongside their internet presence?
<br> 2. Does growth of social movements online tend to follow a similar path or are they all unique in how they form?
<br> 3. Soulellis analysis mostly focuses on English-language work or work created in West. How do revolutionary, urgentcraft art and publishing look differently for many of those in the Global South without internet access? What can we learn from them also?

    Even though I knew how the internet worked from my APCS class, I didn't realize or know 
    fully of the military/defense origins and it's disgusting--but not surprising--that so much of
    technology is based in war and imperialism. These origins can definitely still be seen in our
    internet, given how many Black and Indigenous activists of color have been targeted and murdered
    for their work and visibility online. In addition, we have also seen how whistleblowers like
    Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange have been villainized by American media when
    in reality their actions have actually been beneficial to the non-elite masses. In terms of the 
    internet itself, I am also curious about how they were able to get tubes throughout the ocean
     yet still have horrible public infrastructure in the U.S, but if seen through the lens of 
     who benefits from these success/failures then everything makes sense after all.

   Black Gooey Universe discusses how GUI allowed the jump from black to white screens, but embedded in these advancements for computer and technology is also the history of whiteness and being backed by defense funds. The desire of this move to whiteness is also indicative of other anti-blackness in technology, like Silicon Valley's whiteness, and the persistent inaccessibility of coding, and the uncritical environment of racial harm it can foster due to the separation and hierarchy of programmers / users. The discussion was very reminiscent of work by James Baldwin and also, to me, was also reminiscent of Afro-Futurism ideas. 
This latter discussion of Black Gooey Universe is also the case for Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopization of War, which discussed how the shift from User Interface to Experience Design is worrisome because it also continues to harm/separate users from true agency or understanding of computers, while encouraging the programmers to exploit this. They cite the extreme likelihood of using UX for drone operations, in which the design can take away the guilt of the murderer. I was disgusted if not nauseated at this truth, which is the expected outcome of any venture funded by American defense dollars. At the same time, UX design and other virtual reality has helped people heal from PTSD, so that double-sided reality is something we have to grapple with ethically.
<br>Discussion  Q's:
<br>- Do you think alternative spaces still exist on the internet/computers today? Are they constrained in their existence on the internet and are they still valid/authentic even though they exist on the internet?
<br>- What other ways has the desktopization of war already become a reality? Especially since this article was written 5 years ago in 2016?
<br>- How has this changed your understanding of concepts we have generally accepted and many aspire for, like Coding, UX design, and the Silicon Valley in general? How has the separation of humanities from these fields, viewed as strictly STEM, aided their goals & how can we change this?

   Heather Dewey-Hagborg talks about the dangers of DNA collecting in the context of today's technological innovations and surveillance. She is able to pick up random DNA and mine so much personal information from that alone, and it is generally unregulated but equally as powerful as other sensitive information, like social security or credit card numbers. This was really interesting for me because it made me think about why this information is even "valuable," and how capitalism commodifies everything, even human bodies. I think this is why even our DNA poses security risks to us, because it's information that can be sold, can be utilized, can be used to control. 
I really liked Lauren McCarthy's talk and I thought it was very funny. Her project of stalking people is very ahead of her time and relatable because I love stalking people too, whether it is through people watching or online stalking. She also did a date experiment in which the internet controls her actions and is also ahead of her time because this is what youtubers are/have been doing and gone viral for now! McCarthy also played with the idea of a "smart home" and put herself in control of it, which reminded me of the prophetic, ahead of its time, Disney Channel movie, "Smart House" as well as the movie, "Her," which both feature a woman caretaker technological feature. I think it speaks volumes about our loneliness (alienation from capitalism) because our society is structured in a way that doesn't value or allow people to have community, which is why profit-driven, misogynistic tech is trying to fulfill that need.... And it's VERY interesting that all of these technological figures/virtual assistants, that truly have no gender, are gendered by cis-white men developers as "women."
Finally, I love the ideas about p5 going into prisons and teaching and using culturally relevant materials. At the same time, I think there's also necessary to think about other material forms of giving back, like supporting abolition groups or providing necessary resources/food/aid to immigrant families. This is also what some "engaged journalism" groups/organizations are trying to do, because everything ultimately tied to understanding why/how such communities are disenfranchised. Sydette Harry's article discussed how caricatures of black women continue to dominate narratives and oppress black women online. An example of this is how black women have been completely erased from social trends/movements,  despite being the starters/popularizers of it. This discussion reminded me of how, rather than acknowledging/understanding the cultural significance of AAVE and its proper usage/context, AAVE is often seen and used by nonblack people as "internet slang." Harry then talks about surveillance and how the internet has also specifically targeted and mined personal information or content from black women who are key figures online in fighting against racism and misogyny. This connects to the prominence/common-ness of videos of brutality against black people online (Eric Garner, Michael Brown, John Crawford III, Janay Rice), and it is even more horrible because even as the videos spread, no true beneficial change has occurred in the social conditions for black people--with the benefit even going towards nonblack people. These issues are the foundation for the author's question: "What is the solution for being constantly watched, if no one sees you at all?"
<br>
Discussion Questions: <br>
- In what ways do we parallel McCarthy's experiments, of stalking/controlling oneself or tech, personally? What factors in your life make you do this or make you feel this way?
<br> - What are ways in which we can better "see" marginalized groups online? Is this even possible? How have our own internet/real life habits enabled this harm and what can we do to change this? 
 <br> - In contrast to the negatives listed by these articles, how has technology also been helpful/beneficial to these same issues? What are the factors that limit technology from bringing about that positive change? Can technology be separated from its creators or re-imagined effectively? Has there been examples of this that you have already seen?

   Rosa Menkman's glitch manifesto is really interesting and talks about how glitches in technology are forms of art and meaning in itself. It is futile to attempt to go against it. It reminds me of other counterculture art movements like abstract expressionism, which were "irrational" responses to the absurdity/violence of life post-WWII. It is interesting that human/art tech movements converge in this similar evolution/development. I really resonated with this quote, "Glitches do not
exi s t o u t s i d e o f
h u m a n p e r c e p t i o n .
What was a glitch 10
years ago is not a
glitch anymore." because it reminded me of my internship at a video archive. We were fixing old tape decks and the video we viewed through the deck was glitchy because we still had some errors in fixing it, but it wasn't a glitch to me because it was the only version of it I had ever seen. Hito Steyerl's excerpt discussed how "poor" images relate to capitalism and to general low-brow/high-brow art history. Before, art required many privileges but now, the images and things like memes that we most commonly see and use on the internet can be considered "poor images" and are often created by anyone, and distributed by many. At the same time, this can also be bad because of how the distribution can be co-opted. A real example of this is Pepe the frog, which the creator had to denounce and exile. On the bright side, this kind of "poor image" can also be extremely helpful, as many online leftists have used memes, like above, to help people learn more about the ideology. In addition, I also think memes/poor images can also have cultural values, like how fandoms create their own memes or how different countries have their own as well, and it connects us to one another in different, important ways. An Xiao Mina talked about how memes have been used in social movements around the world and also are embedded with culture. She talked about the hashtagging of social movements, which also made me think about how even though it has helped popularize movements it has also commodified them and stripped them from their true ideological context/requirements. In a sad way, they have been social markers of morality rather than true action/thought. In addition, the "iterations" also made me think about "counter meme culture" and the generational divide between meme habits of millennials vs. Gen-Z and younger. Back then, it was "CHEEZEBURGER" and others but now, it is hard to say there is one unifiable internet meme because we occupy so many different internet neighborhoods.
There is also a discussion about censorship, but I am wary about any discussion of China that happens in western spaces because it feels unfair and voyeuristic, especially considering the unspoken censorship that also occurs here in the U.S. that is not spoken about (Black and Indigenous people of color being censored online for using specific revolutionary language, getting their accounts doxxed or suspended, Twitter only naming China/Russian sources but not others, Twitter limiting users from China/other countries, allowing white supremacy spaces to fester online, etc.). In many ways, it is a subconscious/conscious superiority complex placing America above other countries in terms of ideological freedom and morality, which, considering the history and modern day actions of America (the #1 military superpower) is not only false, but dangerous. <br>
Discussion Q's:
<br> 1. Have aspects of the glitch manifesto made its way into mainstream art or what you see today? Has it/is it mainstream? Does the mainstream-ification of avant garde movements like this harm/take away from its ideological intentions?
<br> 2. Censorship is seen as always bad but is it truly? Why do we think this way (liberalism, American individualism) and in what ways or in what internet spaces might censorship be necessary? What is beneficial censorship that already happens but we take for granted or don't think of as censorship? 
<br> 3. Are poor images really poor images? Although things like memes are created and shared by the people, the people who create the meme content likely had the means to do so--unless they were unfairly made meme content (like marginalized or mentally ill people who became memes through voyeuristic/exploitative means). What can we do about/in response to memes like this?

   Joy Buolamwini discusses how darker skin doesn't get picked up by machine learning due to non-diverse data, and discusses both the need for more inclusion as well as the danger that can come from being included due to how data is leveraged by the police and other oppressive/powerful forces. Mimi Onuoha adds to this discussion, and discusses her experience consciously collecting data and building relationships with the people she extracts data from. In her missing datasets projects, she adds that some data is nonexistent and may be better if it stays that way. She also adds that more data is not equivalent to true systemic change, such as when thinking about improved measures of police brutality. This also reminds me about discussions about how increased visibility is also not a marker of true, beneficial change (like how the BLM movement is so known but nothing has changed, or how more representation in Hollywood/politics really means nothing if the racist/colonial/imperialist systems remain the same). Stephanie Dinkins uses and discusses Afro-now-ism as a way to navigate these data problems, as well as a way to personally think about her community and how to navigate identity in the present and the future.
 <br> Discussion Q's:
<br>1. In what ways has not being included actually benefit marginalized populations? Are there real life examples? 
<br>2. Do the benefits outweigh the costs of visibility in data and data collection?
<br>3. What is your own relationship with data and how do you want it to be instead? What are you comfortable with, what do you want to know more about yourself?

   The Cyber Feminism index is a big storage of different art projects and writing pieces that meditate on ideas of feminism and technology. I focused on 1992 All New Gen, which was a female, nonbinary reimagination of consoles like the Game Boy and which was an exhibition that uses extremely futuristic tech terms to describe the human actions of its lesbian characters. Ari Meleciano's talk focused on sustainable ways of designing for the future, which means working with and not for communities, and also working in circular production. I really enjoyed this discussion and it reminded me of how circles are employed in different non-Western religions and belief systems as a ideological structure, in form of a source of inspiration/enlightenment. Finally, for Tate Ryan-Mosley and Jennifer Strong interview, I enjoyed learning briefly about LA's history of policing in terms of the Olympics and Operation Hammer, which I have heard about briefly in abolitionist circles. The article talks about how there is no algorithm that is fit for policing and that data should not be used for those ends, especially to criminalize a certain location/area as they are trying to do now. It has been used before in various "criminal" documentation storages but work like Hamid Khan's is ultimately what stops these horrible actions.
<br>Discussions Q's:
<br>1. Why has LA been such a site for heavy surveillance/policing and how does that connect with the equally, if not more, prominent tech industry on the west coast? What does this tell us about the framework that tech advancement and usage currently exist in? How are we complicit in this?
<br>2. Can you think of more examples of circular production? What does our current structure actually look like, and who gets most affected by products being "useless" and thrown away? Is this natural/unnaturally or historically different?
<br>3. How can current tech students change their practice to truly work with the community and incorporate these ideas?
