  <H2>Week 1</H2>
  <p id="smoll">Odell discussed how the internet has changed greatly from when she was young. Before, the internet took on a variety of understandable, “realistic” formats in order to get people to start using it and to start understanding it. The “How-to” videos were an integral part of this process, and now, it has transformed to be more informal with people and children filming their own videos on how to do things. However, this has also taken a turn due to sponsorships and hgh self-production videos, which coats such videos in a layer of artifice and makes Odell nostalgic for the before-times when how-to videos were more clearly defined as corporate or not, as well as a time when people could just share themselves both in authentically and mundane ways. They specifically name “A Hole in Space” when people were simply fascinated with being able to see, in real-time, other people in L.A. or N.Y.C. go about their day-to-day lives. Odell also discusses searching out such mundane videos and pictures through specific apps and websites, and is still wondering how we can breach different internet communities now that algorithms and polarization have divided us even online, and how some people will still be violent regardless of such dialogue. 

As for Schwulst’s piece, she discusses what forms and meanings a website can be because people like her students asked her about it. She also explains the technical side of a website, such as it being files in a server. She uses metaphors to explain what a website can be, specifically a room, a shelf, a plant, a garden, a puddle, a falling rock into an ocean, which can be seen as an alternative to the internet as a cloud or as tubes. By thinking about the internet in this way, we do not have to let corporations overrun what it is and what a website can mean, and we can also create a more responsible internet.
1. When we talk about the internet and polarization that occurs on it, why do we focus on reaching across the aisle to those who operate on harm instead of giving more power to those who are marginalized? What can the internet look like if we switched our thinking in this way?
2. In what ways does "old-time" internet (talking to strangers and making friends, seeing people's mundane lives) still persevere today? Is the author completely correct in their analysis or has it simply taken on different forms that they no longer are in touch with? 
3. Why is there always an attempt to connect technology/the internet to nature, and what are the implications of us/dominant society already having divorcing the internet/technology from nature?

  <H2>Week 2</H2>
    <p id="smoll">Lara Baladi, Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age Summary
- Baladi discusses the role of media in the uprisings and social unrest that occurred in Egypt throughout the 2010s. She talks about how the internet enabled more people to know more about the events going on in the country, and her specific art/media project Vox Populi. Through it, she was able to screen videos of Egyption social movements that were previously not seen by many of the local audience because they did not have access to the internet. Artists like her continued making controversial work that broke through and criticized the barriers of the country, and regular people were able to join in on this too with graffiti, or their phone's pictures, videos, and other documentation. However in 2013-14 the government began cracking down on these proletariat forms of expression. This did not stop such groups because the internet could still give them exposure to those inside and outside the country, like through Buzzfeed. At the same time, there is the worry that this digital media will disappear, as her Tahrir Archives info graph shows dead sites. Baladi ultimately concludes that it is important to continue resisting by preserving this information.
Urgentcraft -
Soulellis talks about how art and design have been intertwined with protests and social movements. He goes into his specific experience as a white gay man, who watched the development of gay protest in the pre-2000s. His own fears about his queerness connect to this art and organizing actions, and how these slow developments of discovering one's identity is this "urgentcraft." He talks about his own work and archiving that tries to "slow down" and fight against the speedy content of the internet. This is especially important when he realized through Internet Archive that the Trump administration removed web pages about marginalized groups. He printed out the original Obama pages in an attempt to not forget these actions, and also connects it to other resistant actions people have pursued like printing out politician's tweets, standing in front of a racist art piece then being documented doing that and spread online, etc. Urgentcraft also seeks to rebel against expectations of technology today, like perfection, visibility, and legibility, which also connects to queer identity and struggle. He talks about  his own Queer.Archive.Work and other independent art projects and publications that embody urgentcraft, and they also intersect with topics of community spaces, racism, capitalism, and more. He was also able to digitize material that had never been online previously, and was able to preserve queer or other marginalized peoples' history in this way. He encourages viewers to do urgentcraft as well, and to connect this work to personal struggle and growth.
Questions:
1. What other social movements today have been growing alongside their internet presence?
2. Does growth of social movements online tend to follow a similar path or are they all unique in how they form?
3. Soulellis analysis mostly focuses on English-language work or work created in West. How do revolutionary, urgentcraft art and publishing look differently for many of those in the Global South without internet access? What can we learn from them also?

  <H2>Week 3</H2>
    <p id="smoll">Even though I knew how the internet worked from my APCS class, I didn't realize or know fully of the military/defense origins and it's disgusting--but not surprising--that so much of technology is based in war and imperialism. These origins can definitely still be seen in our internet, given how many Black and Indigenous activists of color have been targeted and murdered for their work and visibility online. In addition, we have also seen how whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange have been villainized by American media when in reality their actions have actually been beneficial to the non-elite masses. In terms of the internet itself, I am also curious about how they were able to get tubes throughout the ocean yet still have horrible public infrastructure in the U.S, but if seen through the lens of who benefits from these success/failures then everything makes sense after all.</p>
