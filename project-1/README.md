[Alienation](http://komdy.github.io/iml300/project-1) is an interactive web experience focused on the idea of alienation of labor. Alienation is the phenomenon where we feel isolated in society and see the objects we consumed as removed from the laborers who created them. 

### Description

Alienation in capitalism is the separation of objects from their physical creators. This project takes you through my personal experiences before shifting you as the laborer itself, in a world that is driven by capitalism and imperialism of Western, Global North nations. When we buy or use or see different things, whether it is clothes or flowers on the side of the road-- or even our own clean college campuses--we often fail to realize that people were integral in bringing about those things--or in being forcibly removed so that we can have those things. This is an intentional move by the powerful, as it allows us to feel less guilt about the systems we forcibly made a part of, and to stay complicit towards the exploitation and abuse of marginalized people (most, if not all, in and from the Global South, which are the non-Western, and often formerly colonized countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America) which is what enables our privilege and capital. This was made for a college student audience to shed light on how these issues may affect us and those around us, to put the issues solidly into our reality and to maintain the pressure created by those before and alongside us.
