    This project was about Alienation in capitalism.</h1>
    <br>
 <p align="center">Alienation in capitalism is the separation of objects from their physical creators. When we buy or use or see different things, whether it is clothes or flowers on the side of the road--or even our own clean college campuses--we often fail to realize that people were integral in bringing about those things. This is an intentional move by capitalism, as it allows us to feel less guilt about the things we consume and use, despite many of those things being created under exploitation and abuse of marginalized people, most, if not all, in and from the Global South (which are the non-Western, and often formerly colonized countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America). 
Also consider: USC has CIA ties, there are significant populations of white USC students and professors that are racist, the school itself displaces nearby poor and Black populations and has a racist colonial history like most if not all other colleges/institutions in U.S.
