    This project was about alienation in capitalism.</h1>

    <a align="center" href="index.html">START OVER. </a>

    <br>
 <p align="center">Alienation in capitalism is the separation of objects from their physical creators. 
     When we buy or use or see different things, whether it is clothes or flowers on the side of the road--
    or even our own clean college campuses--we often fail to realize that people were integral in bringing
     about those things--or in being forcibly removed so that we can have those things. This is an intentional move by capitalism, as it allows us to feel less guilt about
     the things we consume and use, despite many of those things being created under exploitation and abuse 
     of marginalized people, most, if not all, in and from the Global South (which are the non-Western, and 
     often formerly colonized countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America). Also consider for us as college
     students to consider is that: USC has CIA ties, there are significant populations of racist, white USC students
     and professors, the school itself displaced and displaces nearby poor and Black populations & has a
     racist, colonial history, like most if not all other colleges/institutions in U.S. Our voice matters, 
     as shown by USC's recent divestment from oil. We must maintain that pressure.
