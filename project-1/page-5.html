The world is burning.
The water flooded the tracks and I couldn’t get home.
Some people died in their basements. 
I packed up all of my belongings and left for a town in another state. 
It usually takes 2 hours but today it took 5 because everyone was leaving. 
My neighborhood will never be the same. 
It is gone from me.
I froze water bottles to keep my food cold and filled the sinks and bathtubs with water in case we run out.  
I can’t escape the hurricane’s path. 
The cities by us are burning. 
Are we next?
When I go hiking, I see the large swaths of yellow hills. 
“HIGH FIRE RISK / DROUGHT,” say the signs on the trail.  
I think about who lived there before us, about Indigenous sovereignty for the land, and how removing them from this land has brought us here.
I feel sick.
I went to school the next day.
