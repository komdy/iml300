[Scream](https://editor.p5js.org/mendykon/sketches/n4fymCdI0) is an interactive web experience that screams at the viewer when they type the words "scream."

### Description

Scream flips screm games on its head. Instead of the player being the one screaming out of fear or stress, they are the ones being screamed at. The project screams at you when you type "scream," each letter a unique scream. The cursor will also reverberate with the soundwaves of the scream. All  my screams were ethically sourced from my friends (crowdsourced!) or pulled from TV shows, like The Suite Life, Arthur, and King of the Hill. "Scream" is just a funny project, that was also suited for Halloween!
